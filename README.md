# Creative-Computing

# README Society centered design through creative computing #

From my readings of society centered design : > "We designed tools and frameworks to help us see the world in new ways, but they also changed how we think. We shaped frameworks, and in turn they shaped us."

*Design is the future of open source*

From STEM to STEAM, the world of science and maths has developed to the realization of the importance of creativity and arts. This project encouraged me to research into a field I was previously intimated by, coding is all around us. From motion sensor doors to a website, everything is built up from code. 

# Physical computing #

> "Physical computing covers the design and realization of interactive objects and installations and allows students to develop concrete, tangible products of the real world, which arise from the learnersâ€™ imagination." (Pryzbylla, 2014)

Physical computing allows you to turn your design skills into reality, creative projects that could be produced and experimented in the real world. You take data in from light, motion, temperature sensors and paired with control devices like motors, speakers, and lights. 

# Learning log #

Monday:
We were introduced to Arduino circuits, completed simple led circuit and spaceship lights.

Tuesday:
Completed thermometer circuit and clock circuit.

Wednesday:
Completed light based theremin circuit.

Thursday:
Began coding Readme file.

# Arduino circuits #

Playing around with the arduino circuits reminded me of physics class during GCSE, the nightmare of remembering equations with currents and voltage. I forgot how fun it was assembling together a working circuit and the accomplishment you feel when it finally clicks and the little led lights up. 

Physical computing reminded me of my hobby when I was a child, building lego mindstorm circuits and coding the functions for them. It's been a really long time since I've done something like this and I really enjoy using the arduino circuits.
